        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">5. Data Security</h2>
        <p>
          We take the security of your information seriously. We use industry-standard security measures, including SSL encryption for online transactions, to protect your data from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. However, no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.
